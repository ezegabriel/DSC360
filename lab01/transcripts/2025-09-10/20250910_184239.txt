[2025-09-10T18:43:15][user] How many regions in canada?

[2025-09-10T18:43:25][gemma3:4b] Canada is typically divided into **13** regions:

1.  **Atlantic Canada:** (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador)
2.  **Central Canada:** (Ontario, Quebec)
3.  **Prairie Provinces:** (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta)
4.  **British Columbia**
5.  **North** (Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut)

**Important Note:**  There are many ways to categorize Canada geographically, and you might find different breakdowns depending on the purpose (e.g., economic, cultural, administrative).  The above is the most common regional division.

Would you like to know more about a specific region, or perhaps how Canada is divided by another criteria (like provinces and territories)?

[2025-09-10T18:45:14][user] I meant provinces rather

[2025-09-10T18:45:23][gemma3:4b] You are absolutely right to correct me! My apologies for the confusion.

Canada is divided into **10** provinces:

1.  Alberta
2.  British Columbia
3.  Manitoba
4.  New Brunswick
5.  Newfoundland and Labrador
6.  Nova Scotia
7.  Ontario
8.  Prince Edward Island
9.  Quebec
10. Saskatchewan

And of course, it also has **3** territories:

*   Yukon
*   Northwest Territories
*   Nunavut

Thanks for pointing out my mistake!  Is there anything else you’d like to know about Canadian geography?
