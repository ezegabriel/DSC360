q11,What kinds of behavior are considered harassment?,normal,chunk_75,chunk_75,1,"Verbal Harassment - Inappropriate or offensive remarks, slurs, jokes, or innuendoes based on a person's protected status. This form of impermissible conduct may include, but is not limited to, inappropriate comments; verbal abuse, threats, or intimidation; or patronizing or ridiculing statements that convey derogatory attitudes based on protected status.

Physical Harassment - Inappropriate or offensive touching, assault, or physical interference with free movement. This may include, but is not limited to, any physical assault or intimidation directed at an individual due to that person's protected status.

Visual or Written Harassment - The display or circulation of visual or written material that degrades an individual or group based on protected status. This may include, but is not limited to, posters, cartoons, drawings, graffiti, reading materials, computer graphics, or electronic media transmissions, including videos, memes, and other social media content.

Hostile Environment Harassment - A hostile academic, work, or living environment exists where it is permeated by innuendo; insults or abusive comments directed at an individual or group based on protected status; or gratuitous comments on protected status that are not relevant to the subject matter of the class or activities on the job. A hostile environment can arise from an unwarranted focus on sexual topics or sexually suggestive statements in the classroom or work environment. It can also be created by an unwarranted focus on, or stereotyping of, persons in any particular protected status. An environment may also be hostile toward anyone who merely witnesses prohibited harassment in their immediate surroundings, although the conduct is directed at others. Determining whether an environment is hostile stems from the totality of the circumstances, including such factors as the frequency of the conduct, the severity of the conduct, whether the conduct is humiliating or physically threatening, and whether the conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's learning or work.

These behaviors are considered harassment based on protected status.",Harassment policy,1
