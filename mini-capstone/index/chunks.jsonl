It is the intention of that legislation and, in complying, it is the intention of this Centre policy to address the problem of underage and irresponsible drinking and/or use of illicit drugs on our campus should such problems arise.\n\nThe College\u2019s policy regarding the use of alcoholic beverages by students is derived from its general philosophy of student life. Centre students are regarded as persons who are morally and legally responsible for their own conduct within the context of the norms and values of an educational community and as responsible residents of the local community in which the College is located, with respect for the laws of the state and community. As part of its overall educational program and mission, the College provides counseling and educational programs related to alcohol and drug use and abuse.\n\nThe College regards intoxication as irresponsible behavior both because of its effects on an individual\u2019s ability to exercise sound judgment and because of its potential threats to health and safety. Not only do students incur serious risks for themselves and others when they drink to excess, but also they make themselves legally liable to prosecution, as well as morally responsible, when they contribute to irresponsible consumption by others and dire consequences ensue.\n\nStudents who are clearly in a state of intoxication, or who represent a possible threat to their own health and safety or to that of others, or who appear prone to disorderly conduct, are subject to sanctions through the College\u2019s judicial system. In cases of disorderly conduct or vandalism connected with the abuse of alcohol, the fact that the offender had been drinking will not be treated as a mitigating circumstance in meting out sanctions. The Department of Public Safety and other College officials are authorized to issue citations to those who are intoxicated.\n\nThe College campus is not immune from the intervention of law enforcement officers and the College and its officials do not exercise the role of law enforcement officers regarding the personal use of alcohol by students or their guests. The use of alcoholic beverages by students is a matter of individual choice and involves the student\u2019s acceptance of responsibility for whatever legal and personal consequences may ensue. The College does not accept legal liability for student violations of the law."}

Kegs in any form or use are prohibited. Possession of small quantities of alcoholic beverage for private or personal use by individuals of legal age is acceptable. No activity should encourage rapid consumption of alcohol. Furthermore it is prohibited for students to participate in drinking games, such as beer pong. Any student who is in the room when a drinking game is taking place is subject to being cited. The residents will be held responsible for the drinking game/table even if they are not present. Students may be cited for possession of any table/board that could be construed as a beer pong table.\n\nINTERPRETATION OF ALCOHOL POLICY\n\nThe following interpretation is included to clarify understanding what is and what is not permitted under the alcohol policy:\n\nPersons twenty-one and older:\n\n\u2022 MAY drink alcohol in residence halls and fraternities, including from original containers or other appropriately sized containers.\n\u2022 MAY transport unopened containers of alcohol on campus (including in their original container).  \n\u2022 MAY NOT drink alcohol in outdoor public spaces (i.e., porches, patios, courtyards and lawns)\n\u2022 MAY NOT possess or drink alcohol from a communal source (i.e., kegs, borgs, or as part of drinking games)\n\u2022 MAY NOT play drinking games, even when played with any liquid\n\u2022 MAY drink alcohol in places and at events designated by the College\n\u2022 MAY NOT drink alcohol at athletic events unless sanctioned by Athletic Department\n\u2022 MAY NOT drink alcohol in academic buildings and non-residential, non-academic buildings (i.e., Sutcliffe, Campus Center, Warehouse, etc.)\n\u2022 MAY NOT provide alcohol to anyone under the age of twenty-one regardless of campus location\n\u2022 MAY NOT charge in any way for alcohol consumption by others, regardless of age. \n\u2022 MAY NOT permit underage persons to bring in or consume alcohol in their residence rooms.\n\nPersons under the age of twenty-one:\n\n\u2022 MAY be in spaces where legal drinking is occurring.\n\u2022 MAY NOT possess or drink alcohol.\n\u2022 MAY NOT permit underage persons to bring in or consume alcohol in their residence rooms.\n\u2022 MAY NOT carry open or unopened alcoholic beverage containers anywhere on campus.\n\u2022 MAY NOT provide alcohol to anyone."}

Centre College will not condone the illegal possession or use of drugs and cannot and will not protect students from prosecution under State and Federal laws. In addition, possession on campus of paraphernalia for the use of drugs is a violation of College regulations and sufficient reason for disciplinary action against those who are responsible for its presence or allow it in their rooms or vehicles.  Student are also not allowed to possess or consume any cannabis or cannabinoid containing products such as gummies, edibles, or hemp flower, etc. on campus.\n\nCentre intends to send a \u201czero tolerance\u201d message regarding illegal possession or misuse of drugs, or knowingly being in the presence of those who possess or misuse drugs. Students alleged to be in violation of this policy are subject to a conduct hearing and disciplinary action up to suspension from the College. Centre prefers a conduct process focused on developmental discipline and takes a holistic consideration when assigning sanctions, including prior conduct. An example of \u201cknowingly being in the presence of\u201d someone possessing or misusing drugs is standing in a discernable group of people where one or more persons is using drugs when observed by a College official, giving rise to the inference that all those in the group were participating in a drug activity. This is only one example, but there could be many such situations, so students must be sure to dissociate themselves from those possessing or misusing drugs.\n\nStudents found responsible for the manufacturing, or distribution of marijuana, heroin, narcotics, or other controlled substances, except as expressly permitted by law, will be subjected to automatic administrative suspension with conditional return stipulations. Centre College maintains the right to notify authorities in any incident of drug manufacturing or distribution should it be deemed necessary.\n\nIt is widely acknowledged that there are significant health risks associated with the use of drugs and abuse of alcohol. Physical and psychological dependence; damage (in many cases irreversible) to vital organs such as brain, liver, lungs, heart, kidneys, and pancreas; heart attack, high blood pressure and strokes; birth defects; immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to infectious disease; coma; and death have all been attributed to use of illicit drugs or abuse of alcohol. Other less life threatening ill effects, but nonetheless serious in the college environment include nausea, convulsions, insomnia, delirium, depression, nervousness, loss of concentration, and fatigue.\n\nDuring new student orientation each Fall, educational programs about drug and alcohol abuse are presented.

No individual or group may haze another at any time including initiation into any organization or at the time of affiliation with an organization. Centre College defines hazing as any act or behavior whether physical, emotional, or psychological, which subjects a person, voluntarily or involuntarily, to abuse, mistreatment, degradation, humiliation, harassment, embarrassment, or intimidation, or which may in any fashion compromise their inherent human dignity. At Centre, respect for the personal dignity of each student, faculty, and staff member is crucial to our enterprise.\n\nThe College\u2019s endorsement of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) \u201cPrinciple of Ethical Conduct\u201d extends this concept of hazing to all athletic teams. The \u201cPrinciple\u201d states that \u201cStudent-Athletes of a member institution and individuals employed by, or associated with, that institution shall deport themselves with honesty and good sportsmanship. Their behavior shall at all times reflect the high standards of honor and dignity that characterize participation in competitive sports in the collegiate setting.\u201d\n\nThe Student Life Office is committed to appropriate personal, social, and intellectual development of all Centre students and seeks to foster an environment that promotes a positive collegiate experience. Hazing is viewed as detrimental and contradictory to these objectives and will not be tolerated. Any member of the College community who observes a hazing incident should report it immediately to a staff member in the Student Life Office, the Director of Athletics, or the Department of Public Safety. Individuals or groups found guilty of hazing are subject to penalties, which may be as severe as expulsion from the College."}

While the College provides a number of services to support the academic work of all its students (including tutoring), this statement outlines a variety of additional services provided specifically to students with mobility, visual, hearing, or learning disabilities.\n\nSupport services for physical disabilities of students at Centre College are coordinated by the Associate Director of Residence Life & Housing Operations and the Dean of /student Success.

It is the responsibility of the resident to respect facilities of the College. Incidental wear and damage resulting from normal use is a matter for the routine maintenance procedures of the Facilities Management department. The prevention and reporting of vandalism or wanton damage to residence halls (including fraternity/sorority houses), academic buildings, or any other campus facility is the expressed obligation of every individual in the Centre community. Activity or behavior associated with such damage could result in danger for members of our community and is unacceptable.  It is important for residents to report any damages immediately to a member of the Residence Life staff.  Failure to do so could result in fines assessed to the resident's bill.\n\nIn an effort to reduce damages in residential spaces, the college limits students to the use of poster putty on walls. Additionally, any adhesive hook or tape cannot be used, due to the excessive amount of damage they have caused in the past. This includes removable wallpaper.\n\nFor damage incidents or excessive clean-up in residence units in which the individual(s) responsible cannot be identified, each resident of that unit must pay an equal share toward the cost of repair and/or cleaning. If repeated incidents of major damage in the same residence unit occur and if the individual(s) responsible cannot be identified, social privileges of the residence unit occupants may be revoked until such time that the residents demonstrate a commitment to appropriate behavior and can give reasonable assurance that no further damage will occur.\n\nIf the individual(s) responsible for damage can be identified, accountability will be assigned accordingly and will include restitution, a conduct meeting, and possible sanctions.

This office assigns housing to first-year and transfer students and determines opening and closing times for the residences.  Incoming first-year and transfer students will complete a housing application in the housing portal.  In the housing application, each person will share their preferences for key compatibility questions and how they wish for a roommate to present in those same areas.  If incoming students have identified an intended roommate, we do permit this to occur.  Centre requires that the match be a mutual selection, which means one individual creates a roommate group in the housing portal and the other individual must accept the group in order for the two to be paired together.  Additionally, Centre College does not permit incoming first-year students to live with returning students.\n\nFor returning students, housing is assigned through an annual housing lottery, administered in the spring term.  The lottery is based on class year, with rising seniors selecting first, rising juniors second, and rising sophomores third.  Students assigned to a room are obligated to pay the room charge for all terms in which they are enrolled within a given academic year. An additional fee is applied for single rooms or for living in a double room without a roommate.  This includes any single room within a suite or apartment.\n\nIf at any point a vacancy occurs in a room and Residence Life & Housing deems is permittable, the student remaining will pay for the room at the single rate for the rest of the semester.  If it is not possible, the student will have one week to fill the space with another student of their preference.  If the space is not filled after one week, Residence Life & Housing will fill the space.\n\nIf at any point, a resident begins to have difficulty with one or more roommates, we encourage them to participate in a roommate mediation process with their RA or RD to discuss their concerns. Should roommates desire a room change, it is our policy that the roommate desiring the change moves.   If both roommates desire a change and cannot agree who will move, the Residence Life Housing Office will move all roommates involved in the conflict."}

These confidential resources will not tell anyone else your private, personally identifiable information unless there is cause for fear for your safety, or the safety of others, or if the sexual misconduct reported involves a minor.\n\nIf you want details of the incident to be kept confidential, you should speak with one of the following confidential resources:\n\nCentre College Counselors;\nthe College Chaplain;\nParsons Student Health Center staff; and/or\nOff-campus mental health providers or rape crisis providers (even if they are providing services on campus, they are considered providers from outside the College and are, therefore, confidential resources). \nPersons in these positions are not required to disclose any personally identifiable information given in confidence unless given permission by the individual, the allegations involve the physical or sexual abuse of a child or vulnerable adult, or there is an imminent threat to the life of any person.

The Title IX Coordinator may choose to sign a Formal Complaint on behalf of the Complainant, if the Title IX Coordinator determines that the signing a Formal Complaint to initiate an investigation over the wishes of the Complainant is not clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances, including because of the need to protect the safety of the College community or the Complainant.\n\nA \u201cFormal Complaint\u201d is a document filed by a Complainant or signed by the Title IX Coordinator alleging sexual misconduct against a Respondent and requesting that the College investigate the allegation of sexual misconduct.\n\nIf an individual decides to file a Formal Complaint, a detailed statement of the alleged incident(s) must be submitted to the Title IX Coordinator.  If the allegations are determined to potentially violate Federal Title IX Policy, a written (typed, emailed, or handwritten) statement must be signed and dated by the Complainant and submitted to the Title IX Coordinator. The statement should be as specific as possible, including dates, times, locations, a description of the alleged misconduct, and the name(s) of the accused person(s).  A list of any person(s) who may have information that would be helpful to the review and resolution process should also be provided. See the Formal Resolution Process below.\n\nIf the Title IX Coordinator determines an investigation is necessary and appropriate (even in the absence of the filing of a Formal Complaint if the Title IX Coordinator determines it is necessary to protect the safety of the College community or the Complainant), the investigation will normally begin within ten (10) business days, unless unusual or complex circumstances exist, or if the College is closed for regular business purposes (See below, under Formal Resolution Process, for details of what is involved in an investigation).  The investigation will be timely and impartial.  Barring unusual or unforeseen circumstances, the investigation will be completed, including any formal proceedings that occur, within 60 calendar days from the time a formal complaint is initiated.  If the investigation extends beyond 60 calendar days, the College will explain the reason for the delay to both parties and keep them apprised of the modified timeline.\n\nCollege's Responsibility\n\nOnce a Formal Complaint of sexual misconduct is filed, the College is obligated by law to investigate and to take appropriate action, regardless of whether the Complainant wishes to participate or considers the behavior sexual misconduct.

Generally, such actions include but are not limited to the following:\n\nSend written notice to the Respondent of the allegations made;\nProvide a copy of the Sexual Misconduct Policy, which includes a copy of the College\u2019s grievance process, to both parties;\nIf appropriate, establish an agreement between the parties that they are not to initiate contact with the other party or parties until further notice by the College.

Informal resolution is permissible where all parties voluntarily agree to participate in an informal resolution except that informal resolutions are unavailable if the Complainant is a student and the Respondent is an employee.  An informal resolution does not involve a full investigation and adjudication (finding of responsibility). An informal resolution may proceed after both parties receive full disclosure of the allegations, their options for formal resolution, and if the College determines that the particular complaint is appropriate for informal resolution.  If a Formal Complaint is processed informally, the Complainant, Respondent, or College has the option to move the complaint to the Formal Resolution process at any time. The Informal Resolution process and/or mediation are typically not available in cases involving sexual violence, but if the informal process is requested, the parties and the College could agree to pursue an informal process.\n\nEach resolution process is guided by the same principles of fairness and respect for all parties. Resources are available for both students and employees, whether as Complainants or Respondents, to provide guidance throughout the investigation and resolution of the complaint. These resources are maintained by the Title IX Coordinator and available through the Student Life, Human Resources, and Academic Affairs offices, as appropriate.\n\nWhile the resolution processes for students, faculty, and staff might differ from one another, each process will include the following, essential attributes:"}

Either party may appeal the dismissal by giving notice to the Title IX coordinator within 5 days of receipt of the written notice of dismissal.  The appeal of the dismissal will be decided as provided for under Appeals, below.\n\nInformal Resolution Process\nPurpose\n\nThe informal process is an opportunity to resolve an informal complaint through awareness, education, and/or a facilitated discussion.  Informal resolution may be requested by either party, or recommended by the Title IX Coordinator, at any time during the resolution process; however, if the allegations are determined to potentially violate Federal Title IX Policy, a written, signed, and dated Formal Complaint must be filed before pursuing an informal resolution. When pursuing informal resolution, the Title IX Coordinator will provide written notice of all the allegations, explain that each party retains the ability to withdraw from the informal process and return to the formal process at any time before agreeing to a resolution, and explain any consequences from participating in the informal process including what records will be kept or shared.  To move forward to attempt an informal resolution, the parties must provide their written, informed, and voluntary consent."}

The following are examples of possible options, one or more of which may be used to bring resolution to an informal complaint.\n\nPotential Informal Actions:\n\nDistribute a copy of the Sexual Misconduct Policy as a reminder to the person, group, or area where behavior is being questioned;\nEducate all parties regarding the College\u2019s Sexual Misconduct Policy;\nAdvise the person(s) how to communicate the unwelcome nature of the behavior to the alleged harasser;\nConduct a sexual misconduct educational workshop for the designated group or department;\nMeet with the Respondent to raise awareness about alleged inappropriate behavior and provide notice about possible College consequences;\nFacilitate a discussion among all the parties involved, if all parties agree to do so;\nInstitute alternative work/ living arrangements, class schedule, advisor/supervisor arrangements; or\nLimit contact or impose a no-contact order between the Complainant and Respondent.\nStep 2: Document Informal Resolution\n\nAt the conclusion of the informal process, a letter summarizing the outcome(s) of the process will be sent by the College official leading the process to the Complainant and Respondent and other appropriate College officials to bring closure to the matter (see Retention of Documents section in this Policy).\n\nIf the matter is not resolved to the satisfaction of the parties utilizing the informal process, or the College determines the matter should be resolved through the formal process, the Complainant, the Respondent, or the College may pursue the formal process.  In such an instance, the Complainant, the Respondent, or the College may pursue the formal process within five (5) business days of the date on the informal outcome letter.\n\nFormal Resolution Process\n\nThe College offers a formal process leading to resolution of a complaint if the conduct alleged would, if proven, constitute Sexual Harassment under this policy or Federal Title IX Policy; if an informal resolution is not agreed upon or fails to satisfactorily resolve a concern; or if the College determines the formal process is appropriate or necessary.\n\nInvestigation"}

The Complainant and the Respondent will be notified in writing of the investigator(s) assigned to their case.  The investigator will conduct a fair and impartial investigation with the understanding that the burden of proof and the burden of gathering evidence adequate to reach a determination of responsibility rest on the College, not on the parties.

Steps 2-5 will follow.\n\nStep 1: Complainant's Formal Complaint\n\nIf the Complainant has not already submitted a Formal Complaint, then the Complainant will be asked to submit a statement of the sexual misconduct allegations as a Formal Complaint (defined and described above).  If the allegations are determined to potentially violate Federal Title IX Policy, a written (typed, emailed, or handwritten) statement must be signed and dated by the Complainant and submitted to the Title IX Coordinator.

The Complainant should also provide a list of any person(s) who may have information that would be helpful to the investigation and hearing process.  The Complainant will submit the above information to the investigator.\n\nStep 2: College's Response and Investigation\n\nOnce the Complainant has submitted the Formal Complaint, the investigator will likely meet with the Complainant to discuss their complaint and to ask any clarifying questions from the Complaint.  During the meeting, the Complainant will have the right to have present an advisor, but the advisor will not be permitted to participate in any way in the meeting, except to advise the Complainant. The investigator will make sure that the Complainant has been adequately advised of available supportive measures (such as housing reassignments, security escorts, or class schedule changes) that are appropriate prior to a determination of the outcome of the Complaint.

This notice may be a copy of the Complainant\u2019s Complaint statement if it includes this necessary information.  During the meeting with the Respondent, the investigator will ask questions and listen to his/her/their version of the incident. During the meeting, the Respondent will have the right to have present an advisor, but the advisor will not be permitted to participate in any way in the meeting, except to advise the Respondent.  The investigator might need to speak with the Respondent more than once.\n\nStep 3: Respondent's Response\n\nThe investigator will ask the Respondent to provide a written response to the allegations by a specified date or within a reasonable period of time necessary to keep the process moving forward.  The Respondent will be asked also to provide a list of any person(s) who may have information that would be helpful to the investigation and hearing process.

Prior to concluding the investigation, the investigator will provide both parties and their advisors an equal opportunity to inspect and review any evidence obtained during the investigation that is directly related to the allegations raised in the Formal Complaint, even if the College does not intend to rely on that evidence, and any inculpatory or exculpatory evidence so each party can meaningfully respond prior to the conclusion of the investigation.

The Title IX Coordinator will designate one or more persons to conduct the hearing, and the persons may be employees of the College or those from outside the College, so long as all meet the requirements below.  Anyone serving as an Adjudicator must be free from conflicts of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents.  All adjudicators will be trained in the conducting of fair hearings, in the terms of this Policy, and of issues involved in sexual misconduct, including victim trauma, questioning, relevance, and any technology to be used in the live hearing.

The hearing will be conducted via teleconference (such as Zoom) unless the Adjudicator, the Title IX Coordinator, and all parties agree otherwise.  The Title IX Coordinator will endeavor to convene a pre-hearing meeting with the parties, their advisors, the adjudicator, and other necessary persons to set dates and deadlines, discuss intended witnesses, and other procedural matters.\nAll hearings must be recorded or a transcript maintained.\nThe live hearing is closed and generally includes only the Complainant, the Respondent, the parties\u2019 Advisors, witnesses as they are providing testimony, and the Adjudicator, along with any other College officials needed to coordinate the hearing.  The parties must attend the hearing live. In cases where the hearing is conducted in person, if parties are not in the same room, they must be able to participate simultaneously.  If the parties are in different rooms, the College must use technology that will allow the Adjudicator and parties to see and hear the party or witness providing information, simultaneously, and in real-time.\nBoth parties are allowed to have an advisor of their choosing for the hearing. For example, an employee of Ampersand or a parent could serve as an advisor).The advisor (for either party) may be an attorney, but the advisor is not allowed to participate in the hearing in any manner, except to cross-examine witnesses on behalf of the party they are advising.  The advisor may consult with the person they are advising. If a party\u2019s advisor is an attorney, then the College may also have its attorney present.  If a party decides to have an advisor present at the hearing, then the party must provide at least 48 hours\u2019 advance notice that the advisor will be present, along with the name of the advisor, and whether the advisor is also an attorney.  The College will endeavor to inform the other parties if any of the parties is planning to include an attorney advisor in the hearing.\nNo later than 48 hours prior to the hearing, the Complainant and Respondent may each submit a written statement concerning the alleged misconduct, the effect of the misconduct, and the appropriate sanction.  The statement may be submitted to the Title IX Coordinator, but only reviewed by the Adjudicator after the hearing if the Respondent is found responsible for violating the Policy.\nThe Adjudicator has the discretion to limit the testimony or information offered if it is cumulative, irrelevant, or otherwise not helpful to the determination of responsibility or sanction (consistent with the provisions on Evidence, set forth below).\nA party\u2019s or witness\u2019s decision to be absent from the hearing or refusal to answer any questions, including cross-examination, may not be the sole basis for a determination regarding responsibility.\nThe parties\u2019 advisors may ask questions of and cross-examine witnesses (including the other party), but will not ask questions of the party they are advising, except that they may ask follow-up questions of their party after their party has been cross-examined.  All relevant questions and follow-up questions, including ones challenging credibility, must be permitted.  Parties must not be required to submit questions in advance of the hearing.\nBefore a witness or a party answers a question, the decision-maker must decide if the question is relevant and explain any decision to exclude a question as not relevant.  The explanation need not be more than the question is not probative of a material fact.  Questions that are duplicative of other evidence in the record may be considered not relevant.\nThe Adjudicator may ask questions of the Complainant, of the Respondent, and of any other witnesses (except anyone who has not agreed to submit to cross-examination), and will consider the statements and any relevant information in the Investigation Report.\nThe Adjudicator will determine whether the Respondent has violated the College\u2019s Sexual Misconduct Policy.  If there is a determination of violation, then the Adjudicator will also determine, after consultation with appropriate College personnel, and reviewing any statement submitted by a party prior to the hearing, an appropriate sanction(s) against the Respondent.  The Adjudicator will also determine if any remedies are appropriate to provide to the Complainant following the hearing process.\nAfter the hearing is concluded, the Respondent and Complainant will be informed in writing at the same time of the outcome and the rationale for the same.  Both parties will receive notice of any sanctions imposed on the Respondent and any remedies provided to the Complainant.

Sexual misconduct encompasses all forms of sexual harassment, differential treatment based on sex, and gender-based harassment.  Sexual misconduct also includes the threat or the commission of behavior used to obtain sexual gratification against another\u2019s will or at the expense of another such as inducing fear, shame, or mental suffering.  Sexual misconduct includes unwanted sexual acts or actions, whether by an acquaintance, a person in a position of authority, or a stranger that occur without indication of consent of both individuals or under threat or coercion.

Quid pro quo harassment occurs where sexual activity is demanded in exchange for an actual, tangible job or academic benefit.  Hostile environment harassment exists where the conduct creates an environment that may impair another individual\u2019s academic or professional performance, or hinder their ability to function within the community.  Examples of sexual harassment include but are not limited to sexual exploitation; relationship intimidation and abuse; sexually-charged name calling; retaliation against someone who reports sexual harassment; and use of language or the presentation of posters/banners and/or t-shirts that promote the diminishing of a particular sex or gender.\n\nSexual Assault\n\nThe College prohibits sexual assault.  Sexual assault, a form of sexual misconduct, refers to physical acts perpetrated against a person\u2019s will or where a person is incapable of giving consent due to the victim\u2019s use of drugs or alcohol.  An individual also may be unable to give consent due to an intellectual or other disability.  Rape, sexual battery, and sexual coercion are all acts of sexual assault.  Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\nHaving or attempting to have sexual intercourse with another individual without consent. Sexual intercourse includes vaginal or anal penetration, however slight, with a body part or object, or oral copulation by mouth-to-genital contact. \nHaving or attempting to have sexual contact with another individual without consent.  Sexual contact includes kissing, touching the intimate parts of another, causing the other to touch one's intimate parts, or disrobing of another without permission. Intimate parts may include the breasts, genitals, buttocks, mouth, or any other part of the body that is touched in a sexual manner.\nSexual Abuse\n\nSexual abuse refers to two broad types of sexual misconduct by employees and others who are affiliated with the College but are not students. Specifically, sexual abuse means: (1) serial sexual misconduct or (2) child molestation. Serial sexual misconduct means any actual or alleged illegal or otherwise sexual misconduct that has more than one victim and is committed by, or alleged to have been committed by, faculty staff, or volunteers affiliated with the College.  Child molestation means actual or alleged illegal or other sexual misconduct with a minor.\n\nConsent"}

In order for individuals to engage in sexual activity of any type with each other, there must be clear consent. Consent is sexual permission.  Consent:\n\nIs mutually understandable when a reasonable person would consider the words or actions of the parties to have manifested an understandable agreement between them to do the same thing, in the same way, at the same time and with one another;\nIs not merely the absence of a verbally stated \u201cno\u201d, silence without actions demonstrating permission, cannot be assumed to show consent;\nIs never final or irrevocable;\nIs time-limited and situation-specific; even if someone obtained consent from a partner(s) in the past, this does not mean that consent is automatically granted again;\nCan only be given by someone who is free from verbal or physical pressure, coercion, intimidation, threat, or force; and\nCan only be given by someone in an unimpaired state of mind who is able to understand what is happening.\nConsent is not valid if the person from whom consent is sought is impaired by the use of alcohol or drugs, is asleep, passed out, or unconscious. There is not consent when:\n\nA person is forced to submit through the use of forcible compulsion.\nA person does not expressly or implicitly acquiesce in the other party\u2019s conduct under circumstances other than forcible compulsion or incapacity to consent.\nA person is deemed to be incapable of consenting because he/she/they is/are less than 16 years old, has an intellectual or other disability that prevents them from having the capacity to give consent or is physically helpless.\nA person is incapable of giving consent if the person is under the age of 18 and the other person is at least 10 years older at the time of the sexual activity.\nA person is mentally incapacitated or physically helpless due to the influence of any intoxicating substance.\nA person is unconscious or for any other reason is physically unable to knowingly communicate unwillingness to act.\nThe use of alcohol or drugs does not minimize or excuse a person\u2019s behavior or responsibility for committing sexual misconduct. If you were assaulted while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, your intoxicated state does not excuse the behavior of your attacker.\n\nIncapacitation\n\nIncapacitation is a state where one cannot make a rational, reasonable decision because they lack the ability to understand the who, what, when, where, why, or how of their sexual interaction.

Stalking is defined as a course of conduct involving more than one instance of unwanted attention, misconduct, physical or verbal contact, or any other course of conduct directed at an individual that could be reasonably regarded as likely to alarm or place that individual in fear of harm or injury, including physical, emotional, or psychological harm. This includes cyber-stalking, a particular form of stalking in which electronic media such as the internet, social networks, blogs, cell phones, texts, or other similar devices or forms of contact are used to pursue, harass, or make unwelcome contact with another person. Stalking and cyber-stalking may involve individuals who are known to one another or have an intimate or sexual relationship, or may involve individuals not known to one another.\n\nSexual Exploitation\n\nThe College prohibits sexual exploitation.

Bullying or cyberbullying is harassing conduct that may take many forms, including verbal acts and name\u2010calling; graphic and written statements, which may include the use of cell phones or the Internet; or other conduct that may be physically threatening, harmful, or humiliating.  Harassment does not have to include intent to harm, be directed at a specific target, or involve repeated incidents.  Bullying or cyberbullying creates a hostile environment when the conduct is sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent so as to interfere with or limit a person\u2019s ability to participate in or benefit from the services, activities, or opportunities offered by the College.  When such harassment is based on gender, sexual orientation, or perceived gender or sexual orientation, it is considered sexual misconduct.\n\nRetaliation\n\nIt is a violation of this Policy to act or attempt to retaliate, intimidate, or seek retribution against anyone involved in or connected to reporting a concern, the investigation of, and/or the resolution of a sexual misconduct allegation.  Individuals who refuse to participate in the processes described under this Policy are also protected against retaliation for their decision.  Retaliation also includes filing charges against a person for conduct that arises out of the same facts and circumstances but does not involve sex discrimination or sexual harassment, for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege.

Non-College sponsored travel occurs when travel to an off-campus activity or event beyond the boundaries of campus is required as part of membership in a recognized student organization functioning under the auspices of the Office of Campus Activities and Greek Life, but College funds are not utilized to support the travel. In some cases, SGA may support the recognized student organization travel by providing funding for conference registration. This funding does not alter the non-College sponsored nature of the travel. When participating in non-College sponsored travel, recognized student organizations are required to submit the Student Travel Form available via the Office of Campus Activities and Greek Life under \u201ctravel policy.\u201d In addition, the recognized student organization is subject to those requirements described in Section 3 of this policy.\nStudent Life Travel Guidelines.  Centre College, through its affiliated offices and recognized organizations, provides opportunities for student travel to activities that facilitate and/or enhance the learning process taking place within the College community. Participation in such activities shall be limited to members of the College community. These Guidelines do not apply to study abroad travel, or travel under the auspices of the Department of Athletics. Participants in activities involving student travel are responsible for their own behavior and any resulting consequences. The College shall not be liable for any loss, damage, injury or other consequence resulting from a participant\u2019s failure to comply with College rules and regulations, the direction of College employees, or applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, all trip participants are required to (a) comply with the standards set forth in the Centre College Student Conduct Code and with applicable College policies, procedures, rules and regulations, understanding that such compliance is important to the success of the trip and to the College\u2019s willingness to permit future similar activities; and (b) conform their conduct to the standards surrounding the trip and assume responsibility for their own actions, understanding the circumstances of an off-campus activity may require a standard of decorum that may differ from that applicable on campus. Violations of the foregoing requirements may subject participants and sponsoring organizations to disciplinary action. Please note for College sponsored travel, it is the responsibility of the department sponsoring the program to assure compliance with these guidelines including any reference policies such as the College\u2019s vehicle safety policy. The following additional guidelines also apply to all travel activities subject to the Centre College Student Travel Guidelines:\n6.1. Pre-trip Meeting: The faculty member, administrator, and/or recognized student organization in charge of the trip, should hold a pre-trip planning meeting with all participants to discuss the planned itinerary, behavioral expectations, and transportation details.\n6.2. Transportation: The sponsoring College department should be prepared to arrange for transportation by official College vehicle(s), rental vehicle(s), chartered service, or, if necessary, personal vehicles.\n6.3. The following rules apply to the use of vehicles.\n6.3.1. College Vehicles \u2013 When possible, use of college-owned vehicles would be the preferred method of travel.\n6.3.2. Rental Vehicles \u2013 Rental vehicles should be organized by the sponsoring department utilizing College funds and institutional insurance coverage.\n6.3.3. Contract Bus Service \u2013 Adequate insurance coverage for personal injury and property damage must be provided by the bus company.\n6.3.4. Personal Vehicles \u2013 Personal Vehicles should only be used on a voluntary basis. The owners/drivers must provide their own insurance coverage. All student participants choosing to ride in a private automobile do so voluntarily and at their own risk. The College shall not insure or accept liability for any damage, loss or injury resulting from the use of a private vehicle. The College does not provide comprehensive or collision (physical damage) insurance for private vehicles driven on College business, and the owner is responsible for primary liability insurance. The College does carry non-owner excess liability coverage to protect the College and employee in the event of a suit resulting from an automobile accident in which an employee was driving on College business.\n6.3.5. It is the clear preference for faculty/staff to drive on College-sanctioned trips. \n6.3.6. All drivers should be appropriately trained for the trip being undertaken.\n6.3.7. Refer to the full College Policy on Driving for further information about minimum standards and training for driving on College-sanctioned trips.\n6.4. Accident and Medical Insurance The faculty/staff member or administrators responsible for the trip shall communicate to the participants that the College does not provide medical insurance for any student\u2019s participation in trips. All student participants shall be responsible for any medical costs they incur during and/or as a result of the trip.\n6.5. Participation Except with the permission of the appropriate administrator, friends and family of students are not eligible to participate in travel opportunities falling under the Division of Enrollment and the Student Travel Policy. All participants are required to engage in the planned activities of the trip. Unstructured time should be kept to a minimum to reduce the risks inherent in unsupervised activity. The sponsoring department or organization should keep a list of all participants involved in the trip."}

Specifically, any overnight guests are limited to a three consecutive night stay. Residents of a double occupancy room are limited to two overnight guests at any one time.  This policy is intended to protect the rights of roommates, as well as to promote a conducive living/learning environment within the residence halls. The College cannot be responsible for the safety and welfare of individuals staying as guests of our students in residence halls or houses unless such guests have been registered in advance in out housing portal, eRezlife, found at centre.erezlife.com.  Student must complete the guest registration form in eRezlife prior to a guest's arrival.\nResidence Directors and Resident Assistants, Facilities Management staff, and other officials of the College have the right of access to any room at any time for the purpose of supervising conditions regarding damage, safety, health, and compliance with College and residence hall regulations."}
