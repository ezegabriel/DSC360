The Federal Drug Free Schools and Communities Acts Amendments of 1989 require all public and private institutions of higher education to develop, distribute, and publicize a policy establishing standards of conduct regarding drugs and alcohol. It is the intention of that legislation and, in complying, it is the intention of this Centre policy to address the problem of underage and irresponsible drinking and/or use of illicit drugs on our campus should such problems arise.

The College’s policy regarding the use of alcoholic beverages by students is derived from its general philosophy of student life. Centre students are regarded as persons who are morally and legally responsible for their own conduct within the context of the norms and values of an educational community and as responsible residents of the local community in which the College is located, with respect for the laws of the state and community. As part of its overall educational program and mission, the College provides counseling and educational programs related to alcohol and drug use and abuse.

The College regards intoxication as irresponsible behavior both because of its effects on an individual’s ability to exercise sound judgment and because of its potential threats to health and safety. Not only do students incur serious risks for themselves and others when they drink to excess, but also they make themselves legally liable to prosecution, as well as morally responsible, when they contribute to irresponsible consumption by others and dire consequences ensue.

Students who are clearly in a state of intoxication, or who represent a possible threat to their own health and safety or to that of others, or who appear prone to disorderly conduct, are subject to sanctions through the College’s judicial system. In cases of disorderly conduct or vandalism connected with the abuse of alcohol, the fact that the offender had been drinking will not be treated as a mitigating circumstance in meting out sanctions. The Department of Public Safety and other College officials are authorized to issue citations to those who are intoxicated.

The College campus is not immune from the intervention of law enforcement officers and the College and its officials do not exercise the role of law enforcement officers regarding the personal use of alcohol by students or their guests. The use of alcoholic beverages by students is a matter of individual choice and involves the student’s acceptance of responsibility for whatever legal and personal consequences may ensue. The College does not accept legal liability for student violations of the law.

Whenever the use, possession, or sale of alcohol would represent a potential legal liability to the institution, the College is required to prohibit its availability. College officials cannot serve alcohol to students in violation of the law, nor can alcohol be used in places to which the public has ready access, such as athletic contests, in the dining hall, or in other locations that the College may stipulate from time to time.

Large, single-source or community supplies of alcohol are not allowed on the campus.

This includes kegs and/or centrally located, large supplies of alcoholic beverage, which are by inference to be made available to groups of individuals. Kegs in any form or use are prohibited. Possession of small quantities of alcoholic beverage for private or personal use by individuals of legal age is acceptable. No activity should encourage rapid consumption of alcohol. Furthermore it is prohibited for students to participate in drinking games, such as beer pong. Any student who is in the room when a drinking game is taking place is subject to being cited. The residents will be held responsible for the drinking game/table even if they are not present. Students may be cited for possession of any table/board that could be construed as a beer pong table.

INTERPRETATION OF ALCOHOL POLICY

The following interpretation is included to clarify understanding what is and what is not permitted under the alcohol policy:

Persons twenty-one and older:

• MAY drink alcohol in residence halls and fraternities, including from original containers or other appropriately sized containers.
• MAY transport unopened containers of alcohol on campus (including in their original container).  
• MAY NOT drink alcohol in outdoor public spaces (i.e., porches, patios, courtyards and lawns)
• MAY NOT possess or drink alcohol from a communal source (i.e., kegs, borgs, or as part of drinking games)
• MAY NOT play drinking games, even when played with any liquid
• MAY drink alcohol in places and at events designated by the College
• MAY NOT drink alcohol at athletic events unless sanctioned by Athletic Department
• MAY NOT drink alcohol in academic buildings and non-residential, non-academic buildings (i.e., Sutcliffe, Campus Center, Warehouse, etc.)
• MAY NOT provide alcohol to anyone under the age of twenty-one regardless of campus location
• MAY NOT charge in any way for alcohol consumption by others, regardless of age. 
• MAY NOT permit underage persons to bring in or consume alcohol in their residence rooms.

Persons under the age of twenty-one:

• MAY be in spaces where legal drinking is occurring.
• MAY NOT possess or drink alcohol.
• MAY NOT permit underage persons to bring in or consume alcohol in their residence rooms.
• MAY NOT carry open or unopened alcoholic beverage containers anywhere on campus.
• MAY NOT provide alcohol to anyone.

Federal and State laws prohibit the illegal possession or misuse of drugs such as marijuana, barbiturates, amphetamines, prescription tranquilizers, LSD compounds, mescaline, psilocybin, DMT, narcotics (including cocaine), and opiates. Centre College will not condone the illegal possession or use of drugs and cannot and will not protect students from prosecution under State and Federal laws. In addition, possession on campus of paraphernalia for the use of drugs is a violation of College regulations and sufficient reason for disciplinary action against those who are responsible for its presence or allow it in their rooms or vehicles.  Student are also not allowed to possess or consume any cannabis or cannabinoid containing products such as gummies, edibles, or hemp flower, etc. on campus.

Centre intends to send a “zero tolerance” message regarding illegal possession or misuse of drugs, or knowingly being in the presence of those who possess or misuse drugs. Students alleged to be in violation of this policy are subject to a conduct hearing and disciplinary action up to suspension from the College. Centre prefers a conduct process focused on developmental discipline and takes a holistic consideration when assigning sanctions, including prior conduct. An example of “knowingly being in the presence of” someone possessing or misusing drugs is standing in a discernable group of people where one or more persons is using drugs when observed by a College official, giving rise to the inference that all those in the group were participating in a drug activity. This is only one example, but there could be many such situations, so students must be sure to dissociate themselves from those possessing or misusing drugs.

Students found responsible for the manufacturing, or distribution of marijuana, heroin, narcotics, or other controlled substances, except as expressly permitted by law, will be subjected to automatic administrative suspension with conditional return stipulations. Centre College maintains the right to notify authorities in any incident of drug manufacturing or distribution should it be deemed necessary. 

It is widely acknowledged that there are significant health risks associated with the use of drugs and abuse of alcohol. Physical and psychological dependence; damage (in many cases irreversible) to vital organs such as brain, liver, lungs, heart, kidneys, and pancreas; heart attack, high blood pressure and strokes; birth defects; immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to infectious disease; coma; and death have all been attributed to use of illicit drugs or abuse of alcohol. Other less life threatening ill effects, but nonetheless serious in the college environment include nausea, convulsions, insomnia, delirium, depression, nervousness, loss of concentration, and fatigue.

During new student orientation each Fall, educational programs about drug and alcohol abuse are presented. Topics of these programs include:

Health Risks
Federal, State, and Local Laws
College Policy and Sanctions for Violation of Policy
Availability of Counseling and Treatment
Centre offers confidential counseling services for alcohol and drug abuse through Campus Counseling Services located in Parsons Center for Student Health & Counseling. Appointments for counseling may be made by calling 859-238-5740. In addition, the Director of Counseling Services can refer students to off-campus treatment resources, and self-help groups in the community. Any cost of off-campus treatment is the financial responsibility of the student and parents. In addition, Residence Directors and Resident Assistants are annually provided with training in peer counseling and intervention techniques. Alcohol and drug education and prevention programs are available to be provided by Parsons Student Health Center and the Campus Counseling staff.

Students who violate the standards of this drug and alcohol policy will be subject through the usual channels to disciplinary sanctions including possible suspension or expulsion from the College. In addition, violators may be subject to prosecution or imprisonment and/or referral for mandatory treatment/educational services under established laws, which make such violations misdemeanor or felony crimes.

The College chooses to inform students of the laws of the United States and the Commonwealth of Kentucky regarding the use, sale, and possession of alcoholic beverages in Kentucky, and the local option provisions of Boyle County, and also to warn them of the serious legal penalties to which they may be subject if they violate the laws. (Refer to the section on Federal, State, and Local Regulations in this Handbook.)
