Centre College views any form of hazing as contrary to the mission and purpose of the institution as stated in this Handbook. No individual or group may haze another at any time including initiation into any organization or at the time of affiliation with an organization. Centre College defines hazing as any act or behavior whether physical, emotional, or psychological, which subjects a person, voluntarily or involuntarily, to abuse, mistreatment, degradation, humiliation, harassment, embarrassment, or intimidation, or which may in any fashion compromise their inherent human dignity. At Centre, respect for the personal dignity of each student, faculty, and staff member is crucial to our enterprise.

The College’s endorsement of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) “Principle of Ethical Conduct” extends this concept of hazing to all athletic teams. The “Principle” states that “Student-Athletes of a member institution and individuals employed by, or associated with, that institution shall deport themselves with honesty and good sportsmanship. Their behavior shall at all times reflect the high standards of honor and dignity that characterize participation in competitive sports in the collegiate setting.”

The Student Life Office is committed to appropriate personal, social, and intellectual development of all Centre students and seeks to foster an environment that promotes a positive collegiate experience. Hazing is viewed as detrimental and contradictory to these objectives and will not be tolerated. Any member of the College community who observes a hazing incident should report it immediately to a staff member in the Student Life Office, the Director of Athletics, or the Department of Public Safety. Individuals or groups found guilty of hazing are subject to penalties, which may be as severe as expulsion from the College.
